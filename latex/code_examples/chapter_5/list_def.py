# Creating a list in Python

# The following is an empty list
lst_def = []

# or this does the same thing (but this isn't the preferred way)
lst_def = list() 

# The following is a list of integers
lst_1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] 


# The following is a list of characters
lst_2 = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']


# The following is a list of multiple data types
lst_3 = [1, 2.3, 'A', 'Word', True]
