# Creating a set in Python

# The following is an empty set
set_def = set()

# NOTE that set_def = {} IS NOT a set, it is a dictionary

# The following is a set of characters
set_1 = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E' } 

# The following is a set of integers
set_2 = {100, 1, 3, 12, 24 } 

# The following is a set of random data types
set_3 = {(1, 2), 100, 525, 125, 'ksrar', True}
