# Creating a tuple in Python

# The following is an empty tuple
tup_def = ()

# or this does the same thing (but this isn't the preferred way)
tup_def = tuple() 

# The following is a list of integers
tup_1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) 


# The following is a list of characters
tup_2 = ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D')


# The following is a list of multiple data types
tup_3 = (1, 2.3, 'A', 'Word', True)
