# java.util.helpmepls
java.util.helpmepls; (working title) is a book intended to help those who want to learn how to code but have no clue where to start. Instead of making things super complicated, I start from the absolute basics and work up to slightly more advanced topics as a jumping off point for those who want to learn more. The objective of this book isn't to make you a programming god, but rather to give you the tools to learn how to code on your own.
